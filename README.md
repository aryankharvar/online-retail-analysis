## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes a real-world **Online Retail dataset** to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.  
It demonstrates end-to-end **data analysis**, from data cleaning to visualization and insight generation using Python-based tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw transaction data.  
- Identify **high-value customers** and **top-selling products**.  
- Explore **time-based sales trends** and **market segments**.  
- Generate actionable business insights for decision-making.  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Data Source:** Online Retail dataset (UCI / Kaggle)

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed missing and null entries.  
- Filtered out negative quantities and returns.  
- Converted date columns into datetime format.  
- Created derived features:
  - `TotalAmount = Quantity × UnitPrice`
  - Time features: `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`
